<h2>We Can't Do This Without YOU:</h2>

<div class="mid-section">
    <h3>Consider Becoming A Part Of Our Volunteer Team!</h3>
    <p>Without our volunteers we would not be able to operate! They help take care of our horses, they sidewalk to insure the safety of our students, they work diligently in our office to help our cause reach levels we couldn't before. Most of our volunteers come to the barn one day a week for a few hours. </p>
    <p>
        We hold several volunteer training sessions each year for new and experienced volunteers. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the perfect opportunity to gain volunteer requirements for school, clubs or colleges. If you are looking to pursue a career in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, mental health counseling, education, medicine or in the equine industry our volunteer program will be perfect for you.
    </p>

<p><b> All volunteers should be comfortable around children, horses and nature</b></p>
<p><b>We do require that our volunteers be at least 14 years old and able to lift 50 lbs to participate </b></p>
