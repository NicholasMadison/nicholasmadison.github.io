        <h3>"We go for High Hanging Fruit"</h3>
        <p>Natural Monkey is a company that is here to inspire banana enthusiasts to want more from each banana. Well do we have news for you! Starting in March of 2025, The Natural Monkey will launch with our three new bananas that everyone will love. Trust me, fruit enthusiast you're going to want to stay in toon for this!</p>

    <p>First off the tree we have the Protein banana! This banana is to help those gym monkeys trying to impress all the ladies and men. Second, definitely not last, is the low fat banana that can help those who just want a high hanging fruit without having to worry about breaking the scale! Lastly, low carb bananas are the middle of the other two. Therefore the middle class Monkey is just trying to get the best of both worlds while swinging along.
