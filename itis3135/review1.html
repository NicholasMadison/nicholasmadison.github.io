        <h3>Other thoughts:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                I like how they set up the homepage and box in the information so it becomes easily readable.
            </li>


            <li>
                If there was one thing I would say to improve I would like to see the forms to have the same color scheme as the homepage. Meaning that I would love to see that the forms have a section with the gold color as the background while the words are white.
            </li>

            <li>
                Overall I think that Jose has made a pretty impressive webpage and has checked off all the asignment requirements!
