                <div class="pad">The rules for APA 8-ball are designed to ensure fair and enjoyable play for all skill levels. Here's a summary of the key points:</div>
                
                <li>Objective: The goal is to pocket all your designated balls (solids or stripes) and then legally pocket the 8-ball to win.</li>
                <li>Racking: The balls are racked in a triangle, with the 8-ball in the center. The front ball is placed on the foot spot.</li>
                <li>Breaking: A legal break requires the cue ball to hit the rack, and at least four object balls must hit the rails, or a ball must be pocketed.</li>
                <li>Open Table: After the break, the table is "open," meaning players can choose solids or stripes based on the first legally pocketed ball.</li>
                <li>Ball-in-Hand: Fouls result in "ball-in-hand," allowing the opponent to place the cue ball anywhere on the table.</li>
                <li>Winning: To win, you must legally pocket the 8-ball after clearing your group of balls. Pocketing the 8-ball early or fouling while doing so results in a loss.</li>
                <div class="pad"></div>
            </ul>
            
            <ul class="divider">
                <div class="pad">APA 9-ball is a fast-paced and strategic game played with a cue ball and nine object balls, numbered 1 through 9. Here are the key rules:</div>
                
                <li>Objective: The goal is to legally pocket the 9-ball. Players must hit the lowest-numbered ball on the table first during each shot.</li>
                <li>Racking: The balls are arranged in a diamond shape, with the 1-ball at the front and the 9-ball in the center.</li>
                <li>Breaking: A legal break requires the cue ball to hit the 1-ball first, and at least four object balls must hit the rails, or a ball must be pocketed.</li>
                <li>Scoring: Players earn points for each ball they pocket (1 point per ball, 2 points for the 9-ball). The player with the most points at the end of the match wins.</li>
                <li>Ball-in-Hand: Fouls result in "ball-in-hand," allowing the opponent to place the cue ball anywhere on the table.</li>
                <li>Winning: To win, you must score the amount of points needed according to your handicap.</li>
