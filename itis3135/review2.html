        <h3>Other thoughts:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Other than the things I marked on the main review as failed. The main big issue I notice with the page is that on many of the webpages the photos are not loading properly. This can be seen from the homepage all the way to the gallery page.
            </li>


            <li>
                I would also Like to mention that the color scheme of the whole page is very hard on the eyes. I know I mentioned the failure to have a good contrast already but I would love to see what having a better color scheme would look like with this page!
            </li>

            <li>
                I will have to say I love the adding of the events tab with the calendar. It is different than something we have done so far in class and looks very nice!
