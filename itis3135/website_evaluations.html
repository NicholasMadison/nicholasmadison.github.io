            <h3><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
            <p>
                Berkshire Hathaway is a website solely for the purpose of providing information about Berkshire sevices. It has an unordered list that links you directly to other webpages on there services. Berkshire Hathaway is a website that is very much out dated in this day and age. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Contrast: </em> There is not much contrast here with the links being a slight purple. however, After clicking the link it should be noted it does turn to red which is a better contrast against white, not much better though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Repetition: </em> The repetition in style is all you see on the page. The homepage is just a repetitive junk of links spralled all over the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Alignment: </em> The alignment of this page is off since the title of the page is over the second half of the bullets. What the web designer should have done is center the header with in between both unordered list.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Proximity: </em> Berkshire's webpage feels as if I have to go a mile to get to the next link or content at that. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.flyhyer.com/">Hyer</a></h3>
            <p>

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Contrast: </em> Hyer has a very good contrast starting at the top of the page, and keeps this up as you scroll down to see all the colors. It's easy to read the text on the page no matter where you scroll to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Repetition: </em> The fonts used on the webpage along with the color pallet stay consistant. Therefore, Hyer's webpage follows the repetition aspect of CRAP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Alignment: </em> The alignment feels very in your face, but also keeps the sections of the webpage very neat and segmented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Proximity: </em> Each of the sections have information about that section within hands reach. Which makes the page feel very easy to navigate through.
